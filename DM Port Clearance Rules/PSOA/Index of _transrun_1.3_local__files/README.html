OVERVIEW
PSOATransRun is an implementation of the Positional-Slotted, Object-Applicative
RuleML (PSOA RuleML) language. This PSOATransRun release includes a composition 
of a translator PSOA2Prolog, from PSOA RuleML to a subset of the logic 
programming language ISO Prolog, with the well-known efficient XSB Prolog engine.
See http://psoa.ruleml.org for details of PSOA RuleML and PSOATransRun
and http://github.com/ZOUG/psoa2tptp for the repository.

REQUIREMENTS
Operating System: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X
Prerequisites:
  Install Java version 8.0 or higher
  Install XSB Prolog 3.6 or higher (http://xsb.sourceforge.net) to a directory,
  the path of which we will call &lt;xsb_dir&gt;, e.g. ...
  ... in Windows:                C:\Program Files\XSB\
  ... in Linux/Mac OS X:         ~/XSB/

USAGE
Download http://psoa.ruleml.org/transrun/1.3/local/PSOATransRunLocal.jar to 
a directory, the path of which we will call &lt;PSOATransRun_dir&gt;. 
Then follow these steps to use PSOATransRun (1. and 2. being just preparatory):

1. Open a window for a Command Prompt / Linux Terminal
Windows: see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window
Linux: start the Linux Terminal

2. Change the working directory to &lt;PSOATransRun_dir&gt; by executing
   cd &lt;PSOATransRun_dir&gt;
In Windows, if &lt;PSOATransRun_dir&gt; is on a different drive from the current
working directory, the command line option /d should be used:
   cd /d &lt;PSOATransRun_dir&gt;

3. Execute the following command to enter a basic query loop for a &lt;kb_file&gt;:

   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -x &lt;xsb_dir&gt; -i &lt;kb_file&gt;
   
The -x &lt;xsb_dir&gt; part of the command can be omitted if the XSB_DIR environment
variable is set to &lt;xsb_dir&gt;.
&lt;kb_file&gt; is the path of the input knowledge base (KB) file written in PSOA RuleML 
presentation syntax.

Here are copy&amp;paste-ready examples of invoking the query loop command on different platforms,
assuming EDITME.psoa is a file used for repeatedly editing KBs with one's favorite text editor.

Windows (assuming the XSB installation directory &lt;xsb_dir&gt; is expanded to C:\Program Files\XSB\):
   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -x "C:\Program Files\XSB\" -i EDITME.psoa
    
Linux/Mac OS X (assuming the XSB installation directory &lt;xsb_dir&gt; is expanded to ~/XSB/):
   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -x ~/XSB/ -i EDITME.psoa

Advanced query loop variations will be shown via the help command (-?):
   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -?

4. After the message "KB loaded" is shown, queries can be posed. Each query must be 
written without intervening Newline characters and terminated by pressing the Enter key.
One answer at a time will be shown. To get the next answer, press the semicolon key. 
To proceed to the next query, press the Enter key. To exit a query loop, press Ctrl+C, and
optionally change EDITME.psoa and go back to 3 (e.g., via the 'up-arrow' key on most platforms).
